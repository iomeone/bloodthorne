#Bloodthorne
Bloodthorne is a Dota 2 replay parser, written in Rust.
It is fast but still very much in work in progress.

This is a library, to parse a replay have a look at the example repository: https://github.com/gaultier/bloodthorne-examples.

##Restriction
This library only works with **Source 2** replays (and there is no future plan to make it compatible with Source 1 replays).
